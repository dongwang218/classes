Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.

Example 1:

Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".
Example 2:

Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "".
Example 3:

Input: S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "c".
Example 4:

Input: S = "a#c", T = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: S becomes "c" while T becomes "b".
Note:

1 <= S.length <= 200
1 <= T.length <= 200
S and T only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.

Can you solve it in O(N) time and O(1) space?

/*
When writing a character, it may or may not be part of the final string depending on how many backspace keystrokes occur in the future.

If instead we iterate through the string in reverse, then we will know how many backspace characters we have seen, and therefore whether the result includes our character.

Algorithm

Iterate through the string in reverse. If we see a backspace character, the next non-backspace character is skipped. If a character isn't skipped, it is part of the final answer.

See the comments in the code for more details.

class Solution(object):
    def backspaceCompare(self, S, T):
        def F(S):
            skip = 0
            for x in reversed(S):
                if x == '#':
                    skip += 1
                elif skip:
                    skip -= 1
                else:
                    yield x

        return all(x == y for x, y in itertools.izip_longest(F(S), F(T)))
